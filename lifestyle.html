				<h3>You forgot to Pray</h3>
				<p >How many times you pray? How do you pray? You pray for what? Are you tired of praying or you don't know how to? Pray is friendly user and the most convient communication to God. So I want you to look back to your past, just hour past, did you pray? Maybe you'll thinking "for what I will pray". Sometimes we pray for long term goal like "I wanna become Doctor" some pray for short term goal "please do not rain". and all the times some youths pray for shellfish desire.</p>
				<p>There is no luck and chances in this world, luck are for people who do not know God and chances are for people who depends only on their human effort. No need to in bet in life. You need to start praying.</p>
				<p>Pray for everything you want and for sure God will give you what you need. Pray whatever circumstances and God will surely hear you. The day will come you will erase in your vocubolary the words luck and chances and the word bless will be the them of your words.</p>
				<p id="bible-verse">Mark 11:24 ~ Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.</p>

				<h3>Yes toxic: Yes enter</h3>
				<p>They said "what you see is what you get", therefore it depends on what we see and how it affects in our brain. Can we conclude that what we are now depends on what we see, so therfore we conclude it is all because of the eye. But? how about what we hear, what we smell, what we taste and what we feel. Does it's our fault that we love one thing that someones hate it or vice versa. We have different taste in our life, if it's gives joy to us, the next thing is just to embrace the source of it.</p>
				<p>Eventhough some youths are in the same age, they have differences to like something. Youths do not even realize that it can lead them to addiction. You are now in days of social media where you can travel from your sit to the end corner of each country. While watching, listening and studying the specific activity you want, moment by moment you are adopting it's nature and you will realize it at the end that you are actually fall in what you were addicting. </p>
				<p>Be still, be calm and be still again and also think 8 times if you are allowing yourself to be indulge. What you see and what you.. ahh or what other senses you have be careful how to use it, because is act like a window in our character. And the brain serves as door to our heart.</p> 
				<p id="bible-verse">1 Corinthians 15:33 ~ Do not be deceived: "Bad company corrupts good morals."</p>

				<h3>Habbits of Mind</h3>
				<p>What are you doing. Do it improves your talents? Or just for your own time wasting, or what are you thinking everyday? Do you think of music, movies, foods, game,study, work, financial or lovelife. We cannot achieve some goals so we just continually thingking of it. Life is not hard, you just need to work for it, have patience of it and have determination for it.</p>
				<p>Be careful what you think it can cause depression, anxiety lose of confidence. When they say the most diffuclt opponent is yourself, well that is true. Mind versus your conscience. The battle of non-tangible inner core of yourself, you must decide where you want to obey. Hard right it's like you are not making decision by yourself because you are slave by your brain.</p>
				<p>The safest thing to do is to project your mind in good and humble things, because mind is over the body, and the body is enslave to brain.
				Keep in touch in peaceful and healthy living  and your body will follow it.</p>
				<p id="bible-verse">Philippians 4:8 ~ Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable—if anything is excellent or praiseworthy—think about such things. </p>

				<h3>Body Pattern</h3>
				<p>Have you been notice that you have involuntery movements of your body. We execute such things that later on we regret about it, and every day in your dailylife it happens again and again. It so hard to prevent from this actions especially if we are addicted to it. Living in state of unconciuos act are the same to robots. Why? Because robots are unconciuos and they do not have choice to make a choice.</p>
				<p>Before we act we must think before it. Regret always come to the end, and in alphabet "prevention" is always before "regret". Be wise in actions and you will be a wise man. Love yourself, show to others who you are by showing right conduct.</p>
				<P>Most people are visual learners so be a good example. Actions are louder than voice. You spell your name by your actions.</p>
				<p id="bible-verse">Galatians 6:9 ~ And let us not grow weary of doing good, for in due season we will reap, if we do not give up.</p>

			<div id="child-lifestyle-section2" class="container col-12 col-md-10 offset-md-1 col-lg-5 offset-lg-2">
				<h3>Your words</h3>
				<p>Actions are louder than voice, but voice is the most deadly martial art and the dangerious way of combat. And your tongue is your deadliest weapon you ever had. Even you are using soft tone, soft voice and cute words it can be still lead to war. Did you ever kill a person by your words? Are your words are a bullter to make people depress, cry or the reason to cut a relationship? Do not worry if you make someone down, there is a soultion!</p>
				<p>Your mouth is a the most used material to heal all things. By my calculations 100% gurantee it works out. Can you use yout voice to do it?
				It's not difficult to say "how are you", "are you ok" and the most healing word "I'm sorry". You just need to be humble to say healing words. Communicate to people as a doctor to them. Support all people who are weary. Love them by actions and heal them by your words. </p>
				<p>I encourage you to live your life as a reason to be the reason of smile of everybody. Time heals, but it need time,  Your words heals it just need your tongue.</p> 
				<p id="bible-verse">1 Peter 3:10 ~ For, “Whoever would love life and see good days must keep their tongue from evil and their lips from deceitful speech.</p>

				<h3>Stay still, it's enough</h3>
				<p>You need something to live? You need everything to live? You need new phone to live? or it's better you need food rather new phone to live. Does it not comfortable where you are right now? Look carefully maybe you have everything you live, you just want everything you want. The world offer so much that no place in our house to keep it. The sociaty invites you to be with them, to be like them that every body sees you higher that them.</p>
				<p>In material aspect we always want what is new, what is in to industry. Did you bought something higher than the cost of a food for a item that cause only for your enjoyment.</p>
				<p>In sociaty, they invite us to be more and more. It's like show off. In physical attributes skin to skin are the parameters for beauty.
				Profession to profession the parameter of being success. Do you feel it?</p>
				<p>The world want to be more and more. In life to stay humble is enough. All people who are self-proclaim are the people who accept the world invitation. If your life is stable now is's enough. Their is no wrong to improve the way of you live, but for show off? it's different so be still.</p>
				<p id="bible-verse">Philippians 4:12-13 ~ I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty. I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want. I can do all this through him who gives me strength.</p>

				<h3>Did you earned Respect?</h3>
				<p>To gain respect? do we need to work for it? like being a servant to a friend, and serve him always with a respect?. Does respect need to be from others for you to be respect? How does to work to gain respect? Sometimes I wonder does the word "silence" is equivalent to the word "respect". These days one of decieving disguise is neglecting people rather than respecting them.</p>
				<p>Look, for to have a peacefull life you need to respect yourself first. How you dress yourself, How you take care of yourself and how to define respect in your own before you give the definition of it others. In that way you would not need to tell them " where is my respect". They will let you know that you earned they respect to yours own how they treat you.</p>
				<p>Just be humble to yourself have a respect to yourself. Show the world that you a qualified to be respected by being humble.</p>
				<p id="bible-verse">Philippians 2:3 ~ Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility value others above yourselves,</p>
			</div>
			<div id="child-lifestyle-section2" class="container col-12 col-md-10 offset-md-1 col-lg-5 offset-lg-2">
				<h3>Do we have same friends</h3>
				<p>They say "tell me who your friends are and I tell you who your are". I tell you, you yourself does not define who your friends are, you are define how you lead your friends in the way of right. Friends are people who are not blood related to you and still you care them as a family. There are different kind of friends but in a nut shell there are two kinds. The friend that help you to know right things and the other one is joining you to your wrong things.</p>
				<P>So it's better to have a friend who are leading you to right things. You have wealth if you have a friend who pulling you out if darkness. Are you like that kind of friend? Be a good encourager to your friends. Don't let them die in wrong ways. Start them to encourage to be humble. to be like you.</p>
				<p>Do we have the same friends? because if we are you know how to it feel to be safe with them. Influence your friend with love, care, and humblness.</p>
				<p id="bible-verse">1 Corinthians 15:33 ~ Do not be misled: “Bad company corrupts good character.”</p>

				<h3>Say I LOVE YOU Ma & Pa</h3>
				<p>Why it so hard to say I love you? Ma and Pa, while it's to easy to say it to friends. Because the real I love you comes from deepest part of our heart. Your mother and your father are your second of your reason to live in good, healthy and humbleness, because who you are reflects your mother and your father. They fed you, took care of you, nurture you and love you and still it will be till the end of their lives.</p>
				<p>How can you pay it? You need to obey, listen to them, and love them. Obey them for it is for your own good. All words that will come to their mouths are from their heart on what is better to you. Remember obedient is the evidence of love. Listening to their stories are one of the  best way to show your love to them, Even though their stories are been repeated do not lose your willingness to hear. When you are toddler everything you said they listen to it and give what you demand. Love your parents for they love you first.</p>
				<p>Love them. All I can say love them. The best reason to show love to others is because your mother and father love you first.Don't wait the time to past. Time never goes back.</p>
				<p id="bible-verse">Ephesians 6:1-3 ~ Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. “Honor your father and mother” (this is the first commandment with a promise), “that it may go well with you and that you may live long in the land.”</p>

				<h3>Guarding Family</h3>
				<p>Everybody belongs to a family. It's better to lose house rather than to lose home, because your home is where your family are. How can we as youth we need to guard our acts towards our neighbours </p>
			</div>
			<div id="child-lifestyle-section2" class="container col-12 col-md-10 offset-md-1 col-lg-5 offset-lg-2">
				<h3>Enter to Marriage Relationship</h3>
				<p>Do you have a relationship? If who have then Why? Do you know the reason why we need to go first this kind of relationship before entering marriage?. If you have no relationship please be safe to choose who you are willing to be with. If you enter just because of couriosity, jealous to others and for experiences it's your life will be in thorns of roses. It will slowly to choke you till you have no choice but to love a person who you regret to be with.</p>
				<p>First you need to learn first the steps of relationship until to the steps of marriage. For now help yourself to find a humble gentleman/lady for you will surely bless until the end of life. Hope you realize to have a beautifull family, you must enter right relationship. It's better to break your relationship than break it after marriage </p> 
				<p>This is the problem of all youths they don't know what are the good and healthy qualifications of relationships. Now it's time for you to humble yourself for the gentleman/lady will look for you.</p>
				<p id="bible-verse">Proverbs 31:10-11 ~ A wife of noble character who can find? She is worth far more than rubies. Her husband has full confidence in her and lacks nothing of value.</p>
